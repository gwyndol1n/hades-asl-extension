Extensions added to Hades Autosplitter script, includes additional information about current run.


# HOW TO USE

1. Download the script and place somewhere accessable by Livesplit.

2. **IMPORTANT!** Make sure to disable Autosplitter if it's being used.

3. Right-click Livesplit > Edit Layout... > Add > Scriptable Auto Splitter

4. Set the Script Path to the downloaded script.

5. Configure settings.
    - If you wish to customize the layout of the components, either add them pre-emptively, setting the left text to one of the corresponding labels:
        - 'Chamber:'
        - 'Chaos Gates:'
        - 'Story Chambers:'
        - 'Map:'
        - 'Slow Bosses:'
        - 'Fountains:'
    - If TextComponents are already placed, the script will use them instead of creating its own.
    - If 'Create missing text components underneath timer' is checked, all created components will be inserted directly under the timer component.
    
6. Enjoy!
